    * References:

    * and other related stackoverflow threads.
    * From the thread listed above, one nice piece of answer from Sam:

    Taking the Photo
    Get this working first before trying to hide the preview.

    Correctly set up the preview:
    Use a SurfaceView (pre-Android-4.0 compatibility) or SurfaceTexture (Android 4+, can be made transparent)
    Set and initialise it before taking the photo
    Wait for the SurfaceView's SurfaceHolder (via getHolder()) to report surfaceCreated() or the TextureView to report onSurfaceTextureAvailable to its SurfaceTextureListener before setting and initialising the preview.

    Ensure the preview is visible:
    Add it to the WindowManager
    Ensure its layout size is at least 1x1 pixels (you might want to start by making it MATCH_PARENT x MATCH_PARENT for testing)
    Ensure its visibility is View.VISIBLE (which seems to be the default if you don't specify it)
    Ensure you use the FLAG_HARDWARE_ACCELERATED in the LayoutParams if it's a TextureView.
    Use takePicture's JPEG callback since the documentation says the other callbacks aren't supported on all devices

    Troubleshooting:
    If surfaceCreated/onSurfaceTextureAvailable doesn't get called, the SurfaceView/TextureView probably isn't being displayed.
    If takePicture fails, first ensure the preview is working correctly. You can remove your takePicture call and let the preview run to see if it displays on the screen.
    If the picture is darker than it should be, you might need to delay for about a second before calling takePicture so that the camera has time to adjust its exposure once the preview has started.

    Hiding the Preview:
    Make the preview View 1x1 size to minimise its visibility (or try 8x16 for possibly more reliability):
    new WindowManager.LayoutParams(1, 1, ...)
            Move the preview out of the centre to reduce its noticeability:

            new WindowManager.LayoutParams(width, height,
            Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE, ...)
            Make the preview transparent (only works for TextureView)

            WindowManager.LayoutParams params = new WindowManager.LayoutParams(
            width, height, ...
            PixelFormat.TRANSPARENT);
            params.alpha = 0;
    */
